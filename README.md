#### Installation

`acme-theme` is now on MELPA as a package (as of 19. June. 2020)! An example use-package declaration:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package acme-theme
  :config
  (load-theme 'acme t))
```

#### Customization options:

1. Setting `acme-theme-black-fg` to `t` turns the foreground into pure black instead of the default dark gray.

```emacs-lisp
(setq acme-theme-black-fg t)
```
